# Toil Management

**"Toil"** is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as the service grows.

## The 50% Rule
We aim to spend **less than 50%** of our time on Toil. The rest should be spent on Engineering (creating long-term value).

## Process
1.  **Identify:** Log tasks in the [Toil Tracker](./tracker.md).
2.  **Measure:** Review the log weekly.
3.  **Eliminate:** Move the top offenders to the Automation Backlog.
